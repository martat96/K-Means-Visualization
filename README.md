# K-Means-Visualization
Visualization of how the k-means algorithm works.


Project created using Python with the use of libraries such as OpenCV,
Matplotlib, TkInter, Plotly in PyCharm environment. 


The aim of the project was to create a program showing the operation of the k-means algorithm in image processing and analysis. Components of the program:
✓ Simple application menu
✓ Text explanation of how the algorithm works
✓ Loads a photo from a folder on the computer
✓ Implementing the k-means algorithm
✓ Decomposition into 3 components (R, G, B) and showing image pixels on the graph
✓ Displaying the resulting image with pixels classified into the appropriate class
✓ Output plot with clusters and centroids in Matplotlib
✓ Output plot with clusters and centroids in Plotly (on localhost)
